                                                    the northwestern coast of continental Europe. The country includes

                                                    Commonwealth Realms. The United Kingdom consists of four countries:
                                                    England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have
                                                    devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their
                                                    capital cities, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively.

                                                    These are remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the
                                                    late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of

                                                    world’s land mass and was the largest empire in history. British
                                                    influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems

                                                    many of its former colonies.
