                                                    Reception/Kindergarten to Year 11. Students begin their education at
                                                    age 4, and typically graduate at age 16 with a General Certificate
                                                    of Secondary Education (GCSE). GCSE is earned once students complete

                                                    schooling options available to students in the UK. Over 90% of

                                                    Students can also study at fee levying independent schools. These
                                                    schools are not administered by the government, but must still
                                                    adhere to the schooling standards set by the government.

                                                <p>Full-time education is compulsory until age 18 in the UK. After
                                                    completing secondary school at age 16, British students go on to
                                                    attend a Further Education (FE) college for two years, referred to

                                                    directly into the workforce. Admission is based on one’s GCSE
                                                    scores.

                                                    not a substitute for postsecondary education. Instead, it is often

                                                restrictions: those set by your university and those by state-run
                                                official
                                                institutions. First, you must ensure that your university doesn’t have
                                                any
                                                constrain pulling you back from working before dealing with state
                                                officials.
                                                For example, depending on your study course your university may limit
                                                working hours to you, aside from governmental restrictions.
