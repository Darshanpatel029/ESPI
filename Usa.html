                                                    <p>Double Degree (or Dual Degree): 1) Pursuit of two different

                                                    <p>Semester System: Academic calendar consisting of two terms during
                                                        the regular academic year, typically 14 to 16 weeks each in
                                                        duration. Usually fall semester begins in late August or early
                                                        September and finishes in mid-December or later; spring semester
                                                        typically begins in early to mid-January and ends in late April
                                                        to mid-May. There may also be one or more summer sessions, which
                                                        usually are optional and shorter than semesters. Students
                                                        typically must complete eight semesters of full-time study or
                                                        the equivalent to obtain a four-year undergraduate degree in the
                                                        U.S. This is the most common academic calendar among U.S.
                                                        institutions of higher education.

                                                    <p>Summer Session (or Summer School): A period of study during the
                                                        summer that is shorter than a semester and is not considered
                                                        part of the regular academic year. Some institutions divide the
                                                        summer into two or more sessions.

                                                    <p>Trimester System: Academic calendar consisting of three terms
                                                        during the regular academic year, each typically 10 to 11 weeks
                                                        in duration. Unlike in the Quarter System, typically there is
                                                        not a summer session. Students normally must complete twelve

                                                    <p>Just like American students, you will have to submit your
                                                        academic transcripts as part of your application for admission
                                                        to university or college. Academic transcripts are official
                                                        copies of your academic work. In the U.S. this includes your
                                                        “grades” and “grade point average” (GPA), which are measurements
                                                        of your academic achievement. Courses are commonly graded using
                                                        percentages, which are converted into letter grades.

                                                    <p>The grading system and GPA in the U.S. can be confusing,
                                                        especially for international students. The interpretation of
                                                        grades has a lot of variation. For example, two students who
                                                        attended different schools both submit their transcripts to the
                                                        same university. They both have 3.5 GPAs, but one student
                                                        attended an average high school, while the other attended a
                                                        prestigious school that was academically challenging. The
                                                        university might interpret their GPAs differently because the
                                                        two schools have dramatically different standards.
